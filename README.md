Project Title:
  
Cinema Savvy

=======================================================================================

Project Goal:

Build Something Awesome
Requirements:

Must uses at least two APIs

Must use AJAX to pull data

Must utilize at least one new library or technology that we haven't discussed

Must have a polished frontend / UI

Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)

Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals!)

Must have some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc)

Must use Bootstrap or Alternative CSS Framework

Must be Deployed (GitHub Pages or Firebase)

Must have User Input Validation

=======================================================================================

Problem to be Solved:
Lack of simple movie searches. Well known movie sites are crowded with advertisements, cross-promotions and extraneous information. 

Proposed Solution:
Cinema Savvy gives the user exactly what they asked for; pertinent information to their movie search. Search of the movie title will yeild the user the movie poster, movie rating, runtime, and viewer rating. Input of their target zipcode will return the three closest theater locations and display the geographical location of the selected theater.

=======================================================================================

APIs:
1 Fandango
2 Rotten Tomatoes
3 YouTube
4 Giphy

Additional Library:
1 jVectorMap

=======================================================================================

Rough Break Down of Tasks:

=======================================================================================

Tentative (Additional) Feature Implementation:

~ Auto-loaded trailer of the current highest-grossing movie in theaters. This will be dynamically replaced by the trailer associated with target title.
~ Create table under selected theater with values returned by jVectorMap.
